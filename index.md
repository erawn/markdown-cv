## Experience
`2019-2021`
HCI Research Assistant Stanford University
Mentor: Jingyi Li, Stanford HCI
- Contributed conceptually and technically to a novel fabrication method for bespoke clothing.

`2020`
**Algorithms Intern Shaper Tools**
Manager: Alec Rivers

**Artist Assistant Stanford University**
- Created an installation for Terry Berlier with 25 connected stepper motors, driven by a MIDI-based interface.

**Prototyping Studio Technician **
Dept. of Art Practice, Stanford University
- I made tutorials and development tools for VR, 3D Printing, Projection Mapping, and fabrication devices, helped students plan and execute digital and physical projects, and instructed the use of CNC tools and digital software.
