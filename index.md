## Experience
`2019-2021`
HCI Research Assistant Stanford University
Mentor: Jingyi Li, Stanford HCI
Contributed conceptually and technically to a novel fabrication method for bespoke clothing.

`2020`
**Algorithms Intern Shaper Tools**
Manager: Alec Rivers
Wrote a remote continuous-integration testing harness for compiling performance metrics on embedded hardware. Profiled embedded C++ applications and contributed fixes which reduced device startup time by 65%+. Developed multiple experimental interactions for contextual vector design tools.

**Artist Assistant Stanford University**
Created an installation for Terry Berlier with 25 connected stepper motors, driven by a MIDI-based interface.

**Prototyping Studio Technician **
Dept. of Art Practice, Stanford University
I made tutorials and development tools for VR, 3D Printing, Projection Mapping, and fabrication devices, helped students plan and execute digital and physical projects, and instructed the use of CNC tools and digital software.
