## About Me
Ph.D. Student at UC Berkeley. I study programming process: how people work with programs over time to experiment, compare, reflect, and understand the history of their code. I am especially interested in building tools for highly exploratory domains of programming, like creative coding and data science.

I also have interests in the Intellectual History of HCI, the politics of computing, and philosophy of mind.

## Experience
`2019-2021`
**HCI Research Assistant** Stanford University
Mentor: Jingyi Li, Stanford HCI
- Contributed conceptually and technically to a novel fabrication method for bespoke clothing.

`2020`
**Algorithms Intern** Shaper Tools
Manager: Alec Rivers
- Wrote a remote continuous-integration testing harness for compiling performance metrics on embedded hardware. Profiled embedded C++ applications and contributed fixes which reduced device startup time by 65%+. Developed multiple experimental interactions for contextual vector design tools.

**Artist Assistant** Stanford University
- Created an installation for Terry Berlier with 25 connected stepper motors, driven by a MIDI-based interface.

**Prototyping Studio Technician** Stanford University
- I made tutorials and development tools for VR, 3D Printing, Projection Mapping, and fabrication devices, helped students plan and execute digital and physical projects, and instructed the use of CNC tools and digital software.
